Playlist Manager helps users with many playlists easily organize and overview them.

It counts with the ability to sort songs by different parameters, most noticeably by date added to a specific playlist, or over all playlists. This helps users to keep updated with the songs of many different playlist he follows, and easily add them to his own playlists.

Users can also quickly play a preview of any song, as well as play the full song inside Spotify with the Spotify Play Button.
