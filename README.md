Playlist Manager merges the songs of selected playlists into one view, allowing you to easily add and remove songs from different playlists.

Playlist Manager helps users with many playlists easily organize and overview them.

It counts with the ability to sort songs by different parameters, most noticeably by date added to a specific playlist, or over all playlists. It also can filter the songs by name or artist.

Users can also quickly play a preview of any song, as well as play the full song inside Spotify with the Spotify Play Button.
